# Guidance for Obtaining and Managing Dependencies

This file provides step-by-step instructions for acquiring, installing, and managing all required dependencies for the PetServices platform.

## 1. Libraries & Frameworks
- Use npm or yarn to install JavaScript/TypeScript libraries (e.g., `npm install react next tailwindcss material-ui redux`)
- For backend, install Node.js dependencies (e.g., `npm install express prisma`)
- For mobile, use `npm install react-native` or follow Flutter setup guides

## 2. Backend & Database
- Set up PostgreSQL or MongoDB locally or via a cloud provider (e.g., AWS RDS, MongoDB Atlas)
- Use ORM tools (Prisma, Sequelize, TypeORM) for migrations and schema management

## 3. Authentication
- Register for Auth0 or Firebase Auth and obtain credentials
- For JWT, generate a secure secret and store in environment variables

## 4. Payment Gateways
- Sign up for each payment provider (PayMongo, Stripe, etc.) and obtain API keys
- Use sandbox/test keys for development

## 5. Notification Services
- Register for Twilio, SendGrid, and Firebase Cloud Messaging accounts
- Obtain and securely store API keys

## 6. Maps & Location
- Register for Google Maps and Mapbox APIs
- Enable required services and restrict API keys to your domains

## 7. AI & Other APIs
- Register for OpenAI and Cloudinary accounts
- Obtain API keys and configure usage limits

## 8. Analytics
- Set up Google Analytics and Mixpanel projects
- Add tracking IDs to environment variables

## 9. Secrets Management
- Never commit real secrets to version control
- Use `.env.example` templates and a secrets manager (AWS, Azure, etc.) for production

## 10. Configuration Templates
- Store example configuration files in the `RequiredConfigurations/` folder
- Document all required environment variables and their usage
