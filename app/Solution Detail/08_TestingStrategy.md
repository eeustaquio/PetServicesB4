# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy, tools, and best practices for the PetServices Platform.

## 1. Unit Testing
- Automated tests for components and functions (Jest, Mocha, xUnit)
- Code coverage targets (e.g., 80%+)

## 2. Integration Testing
- Test interactions between modules/services (Supertest, Postman)
- Mock external dependencies where possible

## 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- Simulate user scenarios (Cypress, Selenium)
- Test critical user journeys (booking, registration, payments)

## 4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Stakeholder/user validation before release
- Collect feedback and iterate

## 5. Security Testing
- Vulnerability scanning, penetration testing (OWASP ZAP, Snyk)
- Regular dependency updates and patching

## 6. Accessibility Testing
- WCAG compliance (axe, Lighthouse)
- Manual and automated checks

## 7. Performance Testing
- Load and stress testing (JMeter, k6)
- Monitor response times and resource usage

## 8. CI/CD
- Automated pipelines (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps)
- Run all tests on every commit and pull request
