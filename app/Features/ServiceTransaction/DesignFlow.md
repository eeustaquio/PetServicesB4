# Service Transaction Design Flow

## User Flow
1. Customer and provider negotiate service details.
2. Both parties accept and lock transaction as "In Progress".
3. Provider posts updates; customer reviews progress.
4. Provider marks service as complete; customer accepts and payment is released.
5. Customer leaves review.
