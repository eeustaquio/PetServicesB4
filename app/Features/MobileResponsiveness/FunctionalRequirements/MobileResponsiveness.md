# Mobile Responsiveness - Functional Requirements

## Inputs
- User device type and screen size
- User interactions (touch, swipe, tap)

## Outputs
- Responsive UI layout
- Optimized images and assets

## Workflows
1. System detects device type and screen size.
2. UI adapts layout and elements for optimal display.
3. User interacts with mobile-optimized features.

## Edge Cases
- Unsupported device/browser: Show fallback or warning.
- Orientation change: Reflow layout.
- Slow network: Load low-res assets.

## UX & UI Considerations
- **User interface elements:** Responsive grids, touch-friendly buttons, collapsible menus.
- **Navigation:** Mobile menu, bottom nav, swipe gestures.
- **Accessibility:** Large tap targets, readable fonts, color contrast.
- **Design style:** Minimal, clean, mobile-first.

## Technical Requirements
- **APIs / integrations:** None specific, but all APIs must support mobile clients.
- **Database schema:** N/A (UI only).
- **Performance needs:** Fast load, minimal data usage, smooth transitions.
- **Security:** Secure data handling on all devices.
