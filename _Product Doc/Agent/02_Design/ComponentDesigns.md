# Component Designs: Design Phase

## 1. UI Component Library
- List all reusable UI components (buttons, forms, cards, modals, etc.)
- Document props, states, and variations for each component
- Provide usage examples and code snippets

## 2. System Component Diagrams
- Draw component hierarchy for frontend and backend
- Show relationships between UI, API, and data layers

## 3. Accessibility and Theming
- Define color palettes, typography, and spacing tokens
- Document accessibility features (focus states, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Theming support for light/dark modes
