# Booking System - Functional Requirements

## Inputs
- Customer actions (book, reschedule, cancel)
- Provider availability
- Booking details (date, time, service, pet)

## Outputs
- Booking confirmations, reminders, updates
- Calendar entries
- Notifications to customer and provider

## Workflows
1. Customer selects service, provider, and time slot.
2. System checks provider availability and confirms booking.
3. System sends confirmation and adds to calendars.
4. Customer or provider can reschedule or cancel.

## Edge Cases
- Double booking: Prevent or warn user.
- Provider unavailable: Suggest alternatives.
- Last-minute cancellation: Apply policy or notify admin.

## UX & UI Considerations
- **User interface elements:** Booking form, calendar picker, confirmation dialogs, notifications.
- **Navigation:** Service catalog, provider profile, booking history.
- **Accessibility:** Calendar navigation, form labels, error messages.
- **Design style:** Simple, intuitive, mobile-friendly.

## Technical Requirements
- **APIs / integrations:** Internal API for bookings, calendar API, notification service.
- **Database schema:**
  - `bookings` (id, customer_id, provider_id, service_id, date, time, status, ...)
- **Performance needs:** Real-time availability checks, scalable for many bookings.
- **Security:** Authenticated access, input validation, audit logs.
