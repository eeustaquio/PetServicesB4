# Component Designs: Requirements Phase

## 1. Major System Components
- User Management (registration, authentication, roles)
- Service Catalog (listing, search, filtering)
- Provider Management (application, approval, profile)
- Booking System (scheduling, calendar, status)
- Notification Engine (email, SMS, in-app)
- Admin Dashboard (analytics, controls)
- Payment Integration (gateway abstraction)
- Security & Compliance (encryption, audit logs)

## 2. Component Responsibilities
- Each component should have a clear API and data contract
- Document inputs, outputs, and dependencies for each component
- Define ownership and update process for each module

## 3. Initial Component Interaction Diagrams
- Draw sequence diagrams for user registration, booking, and payment flows
- Map data flow between frontend, backend, and third-party services
