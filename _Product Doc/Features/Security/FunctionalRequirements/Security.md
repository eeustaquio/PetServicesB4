# Security - Functional Requirements

## Inputs
- User credentials and sensitive data
- System events (login, data access, transactions)

## Outputs
- Access control decisions
- Security logs and alerts

## Workflows
1. User attempts to access protected resource.
2. System authenticates and authorizes access.
3. System logs event and monitors for anomalies.

## Edge Cases
- Invalid credentials: Deny access, log attempt.
- Suspicious activity: Alert admin, lock account.
- Data breach: Trigger incident response.

## UX & UI Considerations
- **User interface elements:** Login forms, 2FA prompts, security alerts, password reset.
- **Navigation:** Security settings in profile, alerts in dashboard.
- **Accessibility:** Clear error messages, keyboard navigation, screen reader support.
- **Design style:** Trustworthy, clear, unobtrusive.

## Technical Requirements
- **APIs / integrations:** Auth API, audit log API, 2FA provider.
- **Database schema:**
  - `users` (id, name, email, password_hash, role, ...)
  - `security_logs` (id, user_id, event, timestamp, details)
- **Performance needs:** Real-time monitoring, minimal auth latency.
- **Security:** Encryption, RBAC, audit logs, compliance with standards.
