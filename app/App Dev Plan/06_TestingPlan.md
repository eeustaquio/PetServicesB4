| Integration Test  | Test interactions between modules/services        | Jest, Supertest          |
| End-to-End (E2E)  | Simulate user flows across the app                | Cypress, Playwright      |
| API Test          | Validate API endpoints and responses              | Postman, Insomnia        |
| Accessibility     | Ensure WCAG compliance and usability              | axe, Lighthouse          |
| Security          | Test for vulnerabilities and data protection      | OWASP ZAP, Snyk          |

## 2. Coverage & Quality Goals
- Target 80%+ code coverage for all major modules
- Automate regression and smoke tests for every release
- Include accessibility and security tests in CI/CD

---

## 3. Best Practices
- Write clear, maintainable, and isolated tests
- Use test data factories and mocks
- Run tests in CI/CD pipeline on every commit
- Document test cases and expected outcomes
