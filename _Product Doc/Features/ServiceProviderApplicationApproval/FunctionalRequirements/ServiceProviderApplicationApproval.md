# Service Provider Application & Approval - Functional Requirements

## Inputs
- User application data (personal info, credentials, documents)
- Admin review actions (approve/reject)
- System notifications (status updates)

## Outputs
- Application status (pending, approved, rejected)
- Notifications to user and admin
- Role assignment (Service Provider)

## Workflows
1. User submits application with required details.
2. System stores application and notifies admin.
3. Admin reviews and approves/rejects application.
4. System updates user role and notifies user of outcome.

## Edge Cases
- Incomplete or invalid application: Prompt user to correct.
- Duplicate application: Prevent or flag for admin.
- Network failure: Retry or save draft.
- Admin inaction: Send reminders or escalate.

## UX & UI Considerations
- **User interface elements:** Application form, upload fields, status indicators, admin review dashboard.
- **Navigation:** Accessible from user profile/settings and admin dashboard.
- **Accessibility:** Form labels, keyboard navigation, error messages, color contrast.
- **Design style:** Consistent with app branding, clear feedback for each step.

## Technical Requirements
- **APIs / integrations:** Internal API for application submission and review, notification service.
- **Database schema:**
  - `users` (id, name, email, role, ...)
  - `provider_applications` (id, user_id, status, submitted_at, reviewed_at, reviewer_id, notes)
- **Performance needs:** Fast form submission and status updates.
- **Security:** Authenticated access, document upload validation, audit logs for admin actions.
