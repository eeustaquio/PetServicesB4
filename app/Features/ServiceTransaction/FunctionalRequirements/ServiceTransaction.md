# Service Transaction - Functional Requirements

## Inputs
- Customer and provider actions (negotiate, accept, update status)
- Service and pricing data
- Booking details

## Outputs
- Transaction status updates
- Notifications to customer and provider
- Payment release trigger

## Workflows
1. Customer requests service and negotiates details with provider.
2. Both parties agree, status set to In Progress.
3. Provider updates service status, customer checks updates.
4. Provider marks service complete, customer accepts completion.
5. System releases payment and requests feedback.

## Edge Cases
- Disagreement on terms: Allow renegotiation or cancellation.
- Payment failure: Retry or notify support.
- Service not completed: Escalate to admin.

## UX & UI Considerations
- **User interface elements:** Transaction status, negotiation chat, update notifications, feedback form.
- **Navigation:** Booking history, transaction details page.
- **Accessibility:** Status indicators, keyboard navigation, clear feedback.
- **Design style:** Clear, actionable, trust-building.

## Technical Requirements
- **APIs / integrations:** Internal API for transactions, payment gateway API.
- **Database schema:**
  - `transactions` (id, customer_id, provider_id, service_id, status, price, ...)
- **Performance needs:** Real-time updates, secure payment handling.
- **Security:** Authenticated access, audit logs, encrypted payment data.
