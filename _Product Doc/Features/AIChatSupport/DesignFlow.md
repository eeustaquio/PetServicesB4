# AI Chat Support - Design Flow

1. User initiates chat from app interface.
2. AI responds to general queries and provides guidance.
3. If user has a concern, AI offers to create a support ticket.
4. Ticket is created and routed to admin/support team.
5. If AI cannot resolve, escalate to human support.
