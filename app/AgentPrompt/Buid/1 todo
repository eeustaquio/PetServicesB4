### Todo List: Review Solution Plan and Features

1. **Read and Analyze Solution Plan**
   - Open and thoroughly read `_Documentation/SolutionPlanAndFeatures.md`.
   - Extract and list all solution goals, features, and requirements.
   - Note any unclear, missing, or ambiguous points.

2. **Review Feature Documentation**
   - List all files and subfolders under `_Documentation/Features`.
   - For each document:
     - Summarize its purpose and scope.
     - Check for completeness (requirements, flows, acceptance criteria, etc.).
     - Ensure alignment with the main solution plan.
     - Identify any gaps, inconsistencies, or outdated information.

3. **Cross-Reference and Validate**
   - Compare features in the solution plan with those documented in the Features folder.
   - Ensure every planned feature is documented in detail.
   - Flag any undocumented or misaligned features.

4. **Document Findings**
   - Create a summary of:
     - Complete and aligned features.
     - Incomplete, missing, or misaligned features.
     - Recommendations for updates or additions.
    - Create Summary file in Implementation Plan folder and generate content

5. **Prepare for Implementation Planning**
   - Organize findings and notes for use in the next phase (implementation planning).
   - Highlight dependencies, prerequisites, and potential risks discovered during review.

6. **Generate Implementation Plan Files and Information**
   - Generate all required files and comprehensive information in the Implementation Plan folder, including phase breakdowns, technical specs, risks, features, flows, component designs, and review checklists for each phase.
   - Generate an end-to-end task list to build the whole solution, separated into files by phases, and save them in the Implementation Plan folder.
