# DevOps & Environment Setup

This document details CI/CD, environment variables, secrets management, deployment, and onboarding for the PetServices Platform, aligned with the latest requirements and features.

---

## 1. CI/CD Pipelines
- Use GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps for automated build, test, and deploy on every commit.
- Stages: Lint → Test → Build → Deploy (staging/production)
- Integrate code quality checks and security scans.

**Example Workflow:**
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on: [push]
jobs:
	build:
		runs-on: ubuntu-latest
		steps:
			- uses: actions/checkout@v2
			- name: Install dependencies
				run: npm install
			- name: Run tests
				run: npm test
			- name: Build
				run: npm run build
			- name: Deploy
				run: ./deploy.sh
```

---

## 2. Environment Variables & Secrets
- Use `.env` files for local development (never commit to repo)
- Store production secrets in secure vaults (e.g., Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

**Example .env:**
```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db
JWT_SECRET=supersecret
SENDGRID_API_KEY=xxx
```

---

## 3. Deployment Scripts
- Use Docker Compose for local development
- Use Kubernetes manifests or cloud provider scripts for production

**Example Docker Compose:**
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
	web:
		build: .
		ports:
			- "3000:3000"
		env_file:
			- .env
	db:
		image: postgres
		ports:
			- "5432:5432"
		environment:
			POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
```

---

## 4. Onboarding Steps
1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values
3. Run `docker-compose up` to start local environment
4. Access app at `http://localhost:3000`
5. Run tests with `npm test`

## Actionable Checklist
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure environment variables and secrets
- [ ] Write deployment scripts for local and production
- [ ] Document onboarding steps for new developers
