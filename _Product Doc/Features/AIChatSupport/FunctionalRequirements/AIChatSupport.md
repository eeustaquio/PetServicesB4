# AI Chat Support - Functional Requirements

## Inputs
- User messages/questions (text input)
- User profile data (for personalized responses)
- System context (current page, user role)
- API calls to AI service (e.g., OpenAI)
- Support ticket details (if user requests help)

## Outputs
- AI-generated responses (text)
- UI chat updates (display messages)
- Support ticket creation (DB record, notification to admin/support)
- Escalation notification (if AI cannot resolve)

## Workflows
1. User opens chat and submits a question or request.
2. System sends input to AI service and receives a response.
3. AI response is displayed in chat UI.
4. If user has a concern, AI offers to create a support ticket.
5. If user agrees, ticket is created and admin/support is notified.
6. If AI cannot resolve, escalate to human support.

## Edge Cases
- Invalid input (e.g., empty message): Show error or prompt for valid input.
- AI service/network failure: Display fallback message and retry option.
- User cancels ticket creation: Abort process and return to chat.
- AI misunderstanding: Allow user to clarify or escalate to human support.

## UX & UI Considerations
- **User interface elements:** Chat bubbles, send button, text input, ticket creation modal, escalation button.
- **Navigation:** Accessible from main menu, help button, or floating chat icon on all pages.
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels for screen readers, high color contrast, focus indicators.
- **Design style:** Glassmorphic or minimal, following brand guidelines for colors and typography.

## Technical Requirements
- **APIs / integrations:** OpenAI API (or similar), internal support ticket API, user authentication API.
- **Database schema:**
  - `users` (id, name, email, role, ...)
  - `messages` (id, user_id, content, timestamp, is_ai, session_id)
  - `sessions` (id, user_id, started_at, ended_at)
  - `support_tickets` (id, user_id, issue, status, created_at, assigned_to)
- **Performance needs:** Low latency for chat responses (<2s), scalable to hundreds of concurrent users, caching for repeated queries.
- **Security:** Authenticated access, role-based permissions, encrypted data in transit and at rest, input validation to prevent injection.
