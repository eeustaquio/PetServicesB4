# UI/UX Designs & Wireframes

## Overview
The PetServices Platform is designed with a mobile-first approach, prioritizing accessibility, clarity, and ease of use for all user types (Guests, Customers, Service Providers, Admins). The UI/UX is informed by user stories and requirements, ensuring seamless navigation and efficient task completion.

## Themes: Glass Calm Minimalism
The platform features a modern "Glass Calm Minimalism" theme, blending frosted glass effects, soft gradients, and minimalistic layouts for a calming, professional look. Users can toggle between Light and Dark modes for optimal comfort.

- **Light Mode:** Clean backgrounds, subtle shadows, and gentle blue/green accent colors.
- **Dark Mode:** Deep backgrounds with translucent glass panels, soft highlights, and accessible contrast.
- **Theme Switcher:** Users can select their preferred mode in settings; the UI adapts instantly.

### Example Theme Variables
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #4fc3f7;
  --accent-color: #81c784;
  --background-glass: rgba(255,255,255,0.7);
  --border-radius: 18px;
  --shadow: 0 4px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.12);
}
[data-theme="dark"] {
  --background-glass: rgba(30,32,36,0.7);
  --primary-color: #90caf9;
  --accent-color: #a5d6a7;
}
```

### Visual Example
> ![Glass Calm Minimalism Example](https://dummyimage.com/600x200/4fc3f7/ffffff&text=Glass+Calm+Minimalism+Theme)

All UI components (cards, modals, navbars) use glassmorphism, rounded corners, and soft drop shadows for a cohesive, modern feel.

## Design System
- **Colors:** Accessible palette with high contrast for readability (see [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/)).
- **Typography:** Sans-serif fonts for clarity; scalable for mobile and desktop.
- **Spacing:** Consistent padding/margins for touch targets and visual clarity.
- **Component Library:** Based on Material UI or Tailwind CSS for reusable, consistent components.
- **Iconography:** Simple, intuitive icons for actions and navigation.
- **Themes:** Glass Calm Minimalism (Light/Dark mode, glassmorphism, soft gradients)

## Accessibility
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:**
	- Sufficient color contrast
	- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
	- ARIA roles and labels for screen readers
	- Focus indicators and skip links
- **Mobile Responsiveness:**
	- All screens adapt to mobile, tablet, and desktop
	- Touch-friendly controls and layouts
