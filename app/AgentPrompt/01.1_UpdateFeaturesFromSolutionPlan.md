# Agent Prompt: Update and Enhance Features Folder from Solution Plan Changes

## Purpose
This prompt guides the agent to review the latest `SolutionPlanAndFeatures.md` and update all files and subfolders under `_Documentation/Features` to reflect any changes, additions, or removals in the solution plan. It also instructs the agent to enhance the content of all updated files for clarity, completeness, and usability.

## Instructions for the Agent

1. **Review the Solution Plan**
   - Open `_Documentation/SolutionPlanAndFeatures.md`.
   - Identify any new, updated, or removed features, requirements, or workflows.

2. **Synchronize Features Folder**
   - For each feature listed in the solution plan:
     - Ensure a corresponding subfolder exists under `_Documentation/Features`.
     - If a feature is new, create the subfolder and all standard files:
       - `Feature.md`, `DesignFlow.md`, `Timeline.md`, `Review.md`, and `FunctionalRequirements/<FeatureName>.md`.
     - If a feature is removed from the plan, archive or delete its folder.
     - If a feature is renamed, update the folder and all references.

3. **Update and Enhance Feature Files**
   - For each feature, update the following files to match the latest plan:
     - `Feature.md`: Overview and description.
     - `DesignFlow.md`: User and system flows.
     - `Timeline.md`: Updated estimates and milestones.
     - `Review.md`: Review checklist and acceptance criteria.
     - `FunctionalRequirements/<FeatureName>.md`: Inputs, outputs, workflows, edge cases, UX/UI, and technical requirements.
   - **Enhance the content** of each updated file by:
     - Improving structure, clarity, and formatting
     - Adding diagrams, tables, or examples where helpful
     - Ensuring consistency in terminology and style
     - Including actionable checklists or best practices
     - Addressing accessibility, localization, and security where relevant
     - Adding a brief changelog section at the end of each file summarizing major updates

4. **Consistency Check**
   - Ensure all documentation is consistent with the solution plan.
   - Remove outdated content and add new details as required.

5. **Document Changes**
   - Optionally, log all changes made during the update for traceability.
