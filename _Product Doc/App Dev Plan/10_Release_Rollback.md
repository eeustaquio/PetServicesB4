# Release & Rollback Plan

This document outlines the release and rollback strategy for the PetServices Platform, aligned with the latest requirements and best practices.

---

## 1. Release Management
- Use version control tags and semantic versioning for all releases
- Prepare release notes and changelogs for each deployment
- Deploy to staging environment before production
- Use blue-green or canary deployments for zero-downtime releases

---

## 2. Rollback Strategy
| Scenario                | Rollback Approach                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Failed deployment       | Revert to previous stable release/tag     |
| Critical bug in prod    | Hotfix or immediate rollback              |
| Data migration failure  | Restore from latest backup                |

---

## 3. Backup & Recovery
- Automate regular database and file backups
- Test backup restoration procedures periodically
- Store backups securely and offsite
