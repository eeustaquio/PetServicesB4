# Functional Requirements

This document details the functional requirements for the PetServices Platform, organized by feature. Each section includes clarifications, examples, and actionable requirements.

## 1. User Authentication & Role Management
- Secure registration, login, logout, and password reset for all user types (Admin, Service Provider, Customer, Guest).
- Role-based access enforced throughout the platform.
- Email verification and optional two-factor authentication (2FA).
- Session management with automatic timeout after inactivity.
**Example:** Only Admins can access the Admin Dashboard; Service Providers cannot view other providers' bookings.

## 2. Service Catalog & Navigation
- Users can browse, search, and filter services and providers by type, location, and rating.
- Interactive map view displays providers and services geographically.
- Service detail pages show full information and allow direct booking.
**Example:** A customer searches for "dog grooming" in their city and sees results on a map and in a list.

## 3. Service Provider Application & Approval
- Users can apply to become providers via a dedicated form.
- Admins can review, approve, or reject applications with feedback.
- Applicants receive notifications about their application status.
**Example:** A user applies to become a pet sitter; the admin reviews and approves the application, granting provider access.

## 4. Provider Service Profile & Service Management
- Providers can create and edit service profiles, including descriptions, pricing, and images.
- Set and update availability calendar.
- Manage bookings and update service status (e.g., available, in progress, completed).
**Example:** A provider updates their available dates and adds a new service offering.

## 5. Booking System
- Customers can book services for their pets, selecting date, time, and provider.
- Calendar integration for both customers and providers.
- Automated booking confirmations, reminders, and status updates via notifications.
**Example:** A customer books a grooming appointment and receives a confirmation email and SMS reminder.

## 6. Customer Pet Management
- Customers can add, edit, and manage multiple pet profiles.
- Bookings can be linked to specific pets for personalized service.
**Example:** A customer adds two dogs and books separate services for each.

## 7. Admin Dashboard
- Admins can view analytics, generate reports, and manage users/services.
- Feature toggles allow enabling/disabling features for testing or phased rollout.
- System monitoring for performance and error tracking.
**Example:** Admin disables a feature for maintenance and reviews weekly booking statistics.

## 8. Notifications
- Email, SMS, and in-app notifications for bookings, reminders, approvals, and updates.
- Users can set preferences for notification channels and frequency.
**Example:** A provider receives an in-app notification and an email when a new booking is made.

## 9. Security
- All sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Secure password storage (hashed and salted).
- CSRF/XSS protection on all forms and user inputs.
- Audit logs for critical actions (e.g., login, data changes).
**Example:** Failed login attempts are logged and trigger alerts after multiple failures.

## 10. Mobile Responsiveness
- All UI components adapt to mobile and tablet screen sizes.
- Touch-friendly controls and layouts.
**Example:** Booking flow is fully usable on a smartphone.

## 11. Additional Features (Phased)
- Payment integration, advanced notifications, AI chat support, localization, and more as described in the roadmap.
