# Technical Specifications

This document outlines the technical architecture, best practices, and integration details for the PetServices Platform.

## 1. Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js (Next.js), Tailwind CSS or Material UI, Redux for state management
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express.js) or .NET Core Web API
- **Mobile:** React Native or Flutter (optional/PWA)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (preferred for relational data) or MongoDB (for flexible schemas)
- **Authentication:** Auth0, Firebase Auth, or JWT-based custom solution
- **Cloud/Hosting:** AWS, Azure, or GCP
- **DevOps:** GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Docker for CI/CD and containerization

## 2. API Endpoints
- RESTful endpoints for all CRUD operations (users, services, bookings, pets, etc.)
- Authentication endpoints (login, register, password reset, email verification, 2FA)
- Notification and payment integration endpoints
- All endpoints secured with authentication and authorization middleware

## 3. Data Models
- Core entities: User, Service, Booking, Pet, Notification, Transaction, Feedback, etc.
- Relationships: Users have roles; Bookings link Customers, Providers, and Pets; Services belong to Providers
- ERD and schema diagrams to be maintained in architecture documentation

## 4. Integrations
- Payment gateways: PayMongo, Stripe, GCash, etc.
- Notification services: Twilio (SMS), SendGrid (Email), Firebase Cloud Messaging (Push)
- Maps: Google Maps, Mapbox
- AI: OpenAI for chat support

## 5. Security
- HTTPS enforced for all endpoints
- JWT/OAuth for authentication and session management
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Input validation and sanitization on all APIs
- Audit logs for sensitive actions

## 6. Accessibility & Localization
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all user-facing features
- Multi-language support with i18n libraries

## 7. Best Practices
- Modular, reusable codebase
- Automated testing and code linting
- Continuous integration and deployment
- Documentation for all APIs and components
