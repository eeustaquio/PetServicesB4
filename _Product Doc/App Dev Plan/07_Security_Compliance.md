# Security & Compliance Plan

This document outlines the security and compliance strategy for the PetServices Platform, aligned with the latest requirements and best practices.

## 1. Security Principles
- Encrypt all sensitive data in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest
- Use secure password storage (bcrypt, Argon2)
- Enforce strong password policies and 2FA
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Regularly audit logs and monitor for suspicious activity
- Apply least privilege principle for all services and users

- Rate limiting and brute-force protection on authentication endpoints
- Automated vulnerability scanning (Snyk, OWASP ZAP)
- Regular dependency updates and patching

---

## 4. Incident Response
- Define and document incident response plan
- Enable alerting for critical security events
- Maintain audit logs for all sensitive actions
- Conduct regular security drills and reviews
