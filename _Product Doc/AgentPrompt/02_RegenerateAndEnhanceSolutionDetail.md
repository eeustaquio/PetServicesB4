# Agent Prompt: Regenerate and Enhance Solution Detail

## Purpose
This prompt guides an AI agent or team member to review, regenerate, and enhance all documentation in the `Solution Detail` folder, using `SolutionPlanAndFeatures.md` as the authoritative reference. This ensures accuracy, completeness, and up-to-date information as the project evolves.

## Reference
- Always use the latest version of `_Product Doc/SolutionPlanAndFeatures.md` as the source of truth for requirements, features, architecture, and priorities when updating any file in the `Solution Detail` folder.

## Instructions
1. **Review** each file in the `Solution Detail` folder:
    - 01_FunctionalRequirements.md
    - 02_TechnicalSpecifications.md
    - 03_UserFlows_UIUX.md
    - 04_ComponentArchitecture.md
    - 05_AcceptanceCriteria.md
    - 06_Timeline_Milestones.md
    - 07_Risks_Dependencies.md
    - 08_TestingStrategy.md
    - 09_Documentation_Support.md

2. **Regenerate** content as needed to:
    - Reflect the latest requirements, features, and architecture from `SolutionPlanAndFeatures.md`
    - Remove outdated or redundant information
    - Add missing details or clarify ambiguous sections

3. **Enhance** each file by:
    - Improving structure, clarity, and formatting
    - Adding diagrams, tables, or examples where helpful
    - Ensuring consistency in terminology and style (matching `SolutionPlanAndFeatures.md`)
    - Including actionable checklists or best practices
    - Addressing accessibility, localization, and security where relevant

4. **Document** any major changes or enhancements in a changelog section at the end of each file.

5. **Save** the updated files in the `Solution Detail` folder, replacing the previous versions.

## Output
- All files in `Solution Detail` are up-to-date, clear, actionable, and fully aligned with `SolutionPlanAndFeatures.md`.
- Each file contains a brief changelog of the latest updates and enhancements.
