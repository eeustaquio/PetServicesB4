# Component Designs: Development Phase

## 1. Backend Service Breakdown
- Auth Service: JWT, OAuth, user sessions
- User Service: CRUD, profile, roles
- Service Catalog: CRUD, search, filter
- Booking Service: scheduling, status, calendar
- Notification Service: email, SMS, in-app
- Payment Adapter: gateway abstraction
- Admin Service: analytics, controls

## 2. Frontend Component Structure
- Page-level containers for each major view
- Reusable UI components (from design phase)
- State management modules (Redux/Zustand)
- API service layer for backend communication

## 3. Integration Adapters
- Abstract interfaces for third-party APIs (payments, notifications, maps, AI)
- Error handling and fallback logic
- Mock adapters for testing
