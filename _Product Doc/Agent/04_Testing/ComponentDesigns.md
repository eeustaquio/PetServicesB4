# Component Designs: Testing Phase

## 1. Test Suite Organization
- Organize tests by feature, module, and integration level (e.g., `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/`).
- Use a consistent naming convention for test files and test cases.
- Separate test data and fixtures from test logic for maintainability.

## 2. Unit Testing Components
- Each backend service and frontend component should have a dedicated unit test file.
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, DB, services) using libraries like Jest, Sinon, or MSW.
- Ensure all business logic branches are covered (aim for 80%+ coverage).

## 3. Integration Testing Components
- Test interactions between modules (e.g., API endpoints and database, frontend and backend).
- Use in-memory databases or test containers for backend integration tests.
- Validate data flow, error handling, and edge cases.

## 4. End-to-End (E2E) Testing Components
- Use Cypress or Playwright for simulating real user flows.
- Cover critical user journeys: registration, booking, payment, feedback, admin actions.
- Automate regression and smoke tests for each release.

## 5. Mocking and Stubbing Strategies
- Use dependency injection and mocking frameworks to isolate units under test.
- Stub third-party APIs and external services to ensure repeatable tests.
- Maintain a library of reusable mocks and stubs for common scenarios.

## 6. Test Coverage Reporting
- Integrate code coverage tools (e.g., Istanbul, Coveralls) into CI/CD pipelines.
- Set minimum coverage thresholds and fail builds if not met.
- Generate and review coverage reports after each test run.

## 7. Best Practices
- Write clear, descriptive test names and assertions.
- Use setup/teardown hooks to manage test state.
- Review and refactor tests regularly for reliability and maintainability.
