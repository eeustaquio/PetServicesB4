## 📋 **What Changed: PostgreSQL → Firebase**

### **Database Architecture**
| **Before (PostgreSQL)** | **After (Firebase Firestore)** |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Relational tables with foreign keys | NoSQL collections with subcollections |
| SQL queries and joins | Document queries and references |
| Manual database setup and migrations | Automatic scaling and management |
| Complex ORM configurations | Simple SDK operations |

### **Backend Architecture** 
| **Before (Express.js)** | **After (Firebase Cloud Functions)** |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Always-running server instances | Serverless, auto-scaling functions |
| Manual error handling and middleware | Built-in error handling and logging |
| Custom authentication system | Firebase Authentication integration |
| Manual API endpoint creation | Callable functions and triggers |

### **Authentication System**
| **Before (Custom JWT)** | **After (Firebase Auth)** |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Custom password hashing and validation | Built-in secure authentication |
| Manual social login integration | One-click social provider setup |
| Custom session management | Automatic token management |
| Role-based access with custom middleware | Custom claims and security rules |

## 📱 **Firebase-Specific Features**

### **Real-time Capabilities**
```javascript
// Real-time booking updates
const unsubscribe = db.collection('users/{userId}/bookings')
  .onSnapshot((snapshot) => {
    snapshot.docChanges().forEach((change) => {
      if (change.type === 'added') {
        // New booking notification
        showNotification('New booking received!');
      }
    });
  });
```

### **Offline Support**
```javascript
// Firestore offline persistence
firebase.firestore().enablePersistence()
  .then(() => {
    // App works offline
    console.log('Offline persistence enabled');
  });
```

### **Security Rules**
```javascript
// Declarative security at database level
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```
