# Technical Design and Specs: Requirements Phase

## 1. System Context and Constraints
- Define project scope, boundaries, and high-level goals
- Identify regulatory, compliance, and security requirements (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- List all external systems and third-party integrations

## 2. Stakeholder and Persona Analysis
- Document all key stakeholders and their roles
- Create detailed user personas (Guest, Customer, Service Provider, Admin)
- Map stakeholder needs to system requirements

## 3. Requirements Traceability
- Use a requirements traceability matrix to link requirements to features and acceptance criteria
- Track changes and maintain version history

## 4. Initial Data Model and User Flows
- Draft entity-relationship diagrams (ERD) for core data (users, pets, services, bookings, transactions)
- Create high-level user flow diagrams for major journeys (registration, booking, service management)

## 5. Compliance and Integration Points
- List all compliance requirements and how they will be addressed
- Identify all integration points (payments, notifications, maps, AI)
